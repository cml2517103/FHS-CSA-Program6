## Program Description:  
- Write a program to print out the radius, diameter, area, and circumference of a circle.
- The program should get the radius from the user
  - Use double as your primative type for the radius  
- Use a constant definition to store the value of  pi (3.14159).
- Circumference = 2(pi)Radius or (pi)*Diameter
- Area = (pi)*Radius<sup>2</sup>
- Format the output to three decimal places.
- Choose variable names which are meaningful for this problem.
